<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
My goal in making this repo is to explore, learn, practice and build the skills needed to be a proficient front end web developer. I take inspiration from web designs, sites, apps or gadget items I see when meandering around the internet.

<p>
My secondary goal is to make decent content so that others can use and perhaps build on what I have originally made.
